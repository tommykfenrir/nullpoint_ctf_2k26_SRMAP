When I first read the scenario, the phrase "silently disappeared" gave the whole game away. In any digital forensics or footprinting challenge, infrastructure suddenly vanishing is your biggest clue.

Whenever a prompt mentions that blogs, docs, or subdomains were hastily taken offline to hide a mistake, your first stop should always be the Wayback Machine (archive.org). Nothing on the internet is ever truly deleted.

Even though CypherNest nuked their live servers in a panic, the Internet Archive had already captured a snapshot of their exposed configuration data. All I had to do was drop their target domain into the Wayback Machine's search bar.

Clicking through the historical snapshots of their deleted development subdomains brought up the original site exactly as it looked before the cover-up. The leaked config data and the flag CTF{n3st_l4bs_3xp0s3d} were sitting right there on the archived page.
